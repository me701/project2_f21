# Project 2 - Fall 2021

For project 2, the goal is simple: make a GUI for one of several applications. 

## Option 1 

Design and implement a GUI for your Project 1 code.
  
Specifically, the GUI should aid in the design of that fridge by allowing the user

   1. to define the outer dimensions of the fridge
   2. to define the wall thickness
   3. to define the heat sink dimensions and location
   4. to define the heat sink power
   5. to define the heat sink, fridge volume, and 
      wall thermal conductivities

You may also let the user select the discretization (i.e., the "delta x" and "delta y" terms), 
but you can also automate that for the user.  

Finally, upon running the model (i.e., solving the system), the GUI should 

  1. display the temperature everywhere in the fridge volume
  2. display the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures in the fridge volume

## Option 2

Design and implement a GUI for the Love Letter game.  This one is harder than
option 2 (in my opinion), but I want to reward the excitement of those who
liked the topic by offering this option.  

Ideally, the underlying game "engine" (the non-GUI stuff) could be easily
used for a text version of the game and, ultimately, AI development :) 

## Option 3

Propose your own GUI-centered project to me by email ASAP.  I polled the class
earlier, and everyone seemed good with Option 1 and Option 2, but I'm open
to other ideas.


## Deliverable for All Options

  - Tell me what you're doing (text upload in Canvas).
  - All the code, etc., needed.
  - A well-written `README.md` file in your `code` directory that explains
    how to use the tool.
